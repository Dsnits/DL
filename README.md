# IMAGE CLASSIFICATION USING CNN 
CNN Image Classification Using 2D Layers
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks, utilizing 2D convolutional layers to process visual data effectively. CNNs are powerful deep learning models for recognizing patterns and features in images, making them ideal for tasks like object detection, face recognition, and more.

Key Features
Model Architecture:

Build a CNN with 2D convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected (dense) layers.
Experiment with different configurations, such as the number of layers, filter sizes, activation functions (ReLU, Softmax), and regularization techniques (dropout, batch normalization).
Image Data Pipeline:

Preprocess image data: resizing, normalization, and augmentation (rotation, flipping, etc.) to improve model robustness.
Load datasets like CIFAR-10, MNIST, or custom datasets using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.
Training and Evaluation:

Train the CNN using optimizers like Adam or SGD and loss functions (e.g., categorical cross-entropy).
Evaluate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Visualization:

Visualize training progress (accuracy and loss curves) using Matplotlib or TensorBoard.
Display sample predictions and highlight misclassified images.
Visualize learned features (e.g., feature maps) from convolutional layers.
Technology Stack:

Frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab (optional)
Deployment (Optional):

Deploy the trained model using Flask or FastAPI for inference in real-world applications.
Save the model in formats like .h5 or ONNX for portability.
Use Cases
Object Recognition: Identify objects in real-world images or videos.
Medical Imaging: Classify medical images for diagnosis (e.g., X-rays, MRIs).
Autonomous Vehicles: Detect objects like pedestrians or traffic sigN
